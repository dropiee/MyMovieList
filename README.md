Inspired by MyAnimeList and Letterboxd

MyMovieList is a movie database searcher and organizer. Type the title of the movie you want to look for below and add it to your list!

The title field is required. Movies titles must be the exact title of the movie, including any special characters (e.g. "Am√©lie" not "Amelie", "Dune: Part Two" not "Dune 2" or "Dune Part Two").

Uses [OMDB's API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch information for movies.

Made with Javascript and created as a project for Uplift's full stack program.
